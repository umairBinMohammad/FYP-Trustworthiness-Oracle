The patch improves error message handling by detecting CLIXML formatted stderr output (used by PowerShell for structured error messages) and properly decoding it to extract the actual error content, while maintaining backward compatibility with non-CLIXML output and gracefully handling parsing failures by falling back to the original output. This is particularly important for Windows remote management via WinRM/PSRP where PowerShell errors are often wrapped in CLIXML format.
