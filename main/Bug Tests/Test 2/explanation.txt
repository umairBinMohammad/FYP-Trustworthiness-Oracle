The patched code enhances Linux distribution detection by improving version parsing for 
Debian/Ubuntu systems, adding support for newer distributions like Rocky Linux 
and AlmaLinux, and updating OS family mappings to reflect current ecosystem relationships.
Key improvements include more robust version number extraction from release files, 
better handling of distribution variants, and the addition of minor version tracking 
while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality. The changes make 
the distribution facts more accurate and comprehensive, particularly for modern Linux 
distributions and edge cases, without breaking existing behavior for older systems or different operating systems.
