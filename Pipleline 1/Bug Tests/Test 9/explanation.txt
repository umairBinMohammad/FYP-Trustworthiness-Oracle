In is_body_allowed_for_status_code, added proper type checking for string status codes and error handling when converting to int.
In create_model_field, restructured the ModelField creation to be more explicit and separated the Pydantic v1/v2 logic more clearly.
Added proper exception chaining using from e in the error handling.
Fixed some potential type safety issues by being more explicit about the ModelField construction.
