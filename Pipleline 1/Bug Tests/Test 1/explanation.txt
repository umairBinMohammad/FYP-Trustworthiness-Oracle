It replaces the Ansible-specific version import with the standard distutils.version import, 
making the code more portable and reducing dependency on Ansible.
It adds Python 2 compatibility by properly handling string literals in the comparison method, 
including checking for both str and unicode types in Python 2. 
This ensures consistent behavior across Python versions while maintaining the same semantic versioning functionality. 
The sys import is added to facilitate version detection.
