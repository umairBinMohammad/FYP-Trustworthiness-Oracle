Added cycle detection in get_flat_dependant() to prevent infinite recursion
Improved type hints for dictionary types in solve_dependencies()
Added proper list copying to prevent mutation of original parameter lists
Fixed potential mutable default argument issue in get_flat_dependant()
Added proper error handling for dependency resolution
The fixed code maintains all original functionality while being more robust 
against edge cases like circular dependencies and improper parameter handling. 
The dependency resolution system now better handles complex dependency graphs 
while preventing common pitfalls like shared mutable state between requests. 
The type hints have been tightened to catch more potential issues at development 
time rather than runtime.
