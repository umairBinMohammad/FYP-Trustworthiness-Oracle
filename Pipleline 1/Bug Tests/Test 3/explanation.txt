The patched version improves collection handling by adding explicit support for collection inheritance through the extend=True parameter, optimizing the builtin/legacy collection check with a single any() call, and cleaning up the return value logic in _load_collections. These changes maintain backward compatibility while making the collection resolution more robust and efficient, particularly for complex playbook inheritance scenarios. The modifications also improve code clarity by removing redundant checks and simplifying the control flow.
